# An Enhanced Object-Oriented Programming-Based Web Page Linker

This project introduces an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)-based Web Page Linker** designed to revolutionize web scraping and data extraction. By encapsulating web page functionality into reusable Python modules or libraries, it simplifies the complexities of traditional web scraping and enhances efficiency.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Approach**: Encapsulates web scraping tasks into reusable Python classes.
- **AI Integration**: Automatically identifies key web page elements (e.g., `<div>` tags) for efficient data extraction.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Handles diverse web page structures and layouts seamlessly.
- **Efficient Web Interaction**: Integrates Beautiful Soup for parsing and Selenium for dynamic interactions.
- **Code Reusability**: Reduces code redundancy and complexity.
