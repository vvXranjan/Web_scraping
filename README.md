## **⚙️ Workflow**  
The **Web-Scraper Optimizer** follows a structured approach:  

1️⃣ **Data Extraction** – Uses BeautifulSoup/Selenium for scraping static & dynamic websites.  
2️⃣ **Data Processing** – Cleans and structures the extracted data.  
3️⃣ **AI-Powered Optimization** – Adapts scraping logic based on website structure changes.  
4️⃣ **Multi-threading & AsyncIO** – Ensures fast and efficient scraping.  
5️⃣ **Storage & Export** – Saves data in JSON, CSV, or databases.
